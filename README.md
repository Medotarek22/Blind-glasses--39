The scientific idea:-

It is that the sensors used in the glasses send signals to the side vibrators that help the user locate the barrier in front of him in an easy and simple way.



Tools:-

1 Battery  9-12V
1 Arduino UNO R3
1 Arduino UNO R3 case
1 Arduino UNO USB programming cable 
3 Ulteasonic sensor HC-SR04
1 Buzzer 5V 
20 Jumper wire Male To Female 
20 Jumper wire Male To male 
1 Connector Cable wire 1m 8pin
1 BMS 1S (5V-1A) Type C
1 Battery Holder 
2 DC Vibration motor


Explanation of the device:-

 The 3 sensors were connected to the three sides of the glasses from the right side, the left side and the front side. Using the Arduino piece, the programming language was used to determine the angle of capture of the signal and the distance to determine the targets that meet it and send a signal the moment of capturing any signal in its field to the side vibrators used on both sides and in front of the device to warn  The user is aware of the presence of an obstacle in front of him and how close the obstacle is to the user, which determines the strength of the tremor that is sent to the vibrator specified for him. The vibrators were distributed on both sides of the device, as the vibrator on the left side works with the sensor on the left side as well, and the vibrator on the right side works with the sensor that works on  The right side also, and as for the sensor in the front, a device is used with it that emits a small beep sound, and its strength is also determined by the distance between the obstacle and the sensor.




future developments:-
*Reducing size and weight for ease of carrying and improving the overall appearance of the user.
*The use of more accurate electronic parts, the speed of response to commands to avoid errors.
*We seek to dispense with conductive wires with other wireless parts.
